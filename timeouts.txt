T3 Timeout ( Ranging Request Retries Exhausted )
Explanation: The cable modem has sent 16 Ranging Request (RNG-REQ) messages 
without receiving a Ranging Response (RNG-RSP) message in reply from the CMTS. 
The cable modem is therefore resetting its cable interface and restarting the registration process. 
This typically is caused by noise on the upstream that causes the loss of MAC-layer messages. 
Noise could also raise the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the upstream to a point where the cable modem¿s 
power level is insufficient to transmit any messages. If the cable modem cannot raise its upstream 
transmit power level to a level that allows successful communication within the maximum timeout period, 
it resets its cable interface and restarts the registration process. This error message is DOCSIS 
event message is R03.0, Ranging Request.

T4 Timeout ( Received Response to Broadcast Maintenance Request, But no Unicast Maintenance opportunities received )
Explanation: The cable modem did not received a station maintenance opportunity in which to transmit a Ranging 
Request (RNG-REQ) message within the T4 timeout period (30 to 35 seconds). The cable modem is resetting its 
cable interface and restarting the registration process. Typically, this indicates an occasional, temporary 
loss of service, but if the problem persists, check for possible service outages or maintenance activity on 
this particular headend system. This error message is DOCSIS event message is R04.0, Ranging Request.
